 Human Detection using Raspberry Pi & Thermal Imaging 

 About
 This project uses a Raspberry Pi with an MLX90640 thermal camera and a trained  learning model to detect human presence based on thermal images in low visibility areas. It applies temperature smoothing, preprocessing, and classification to determine whether a human is detected in the camera feed.
